# Pepsi Sales & Operations Automation

## Overview
Inspired by modern data pipelines, this project centralized Pepsi’s sales and operational data into a single SQL database. The goal was to reduce manual effort, improve data accuracy, and provide real-time insights to support decision-making across the organization.

## Dashboard & Analytics
The centralized data enabled the development of a **Power BI dashboard** to visualize sales performance from store-level to regional insights. Teams could monitor promotions and track KPIs more efficiently, gaining faster and actionable insights.

## Field Operations
To support field teams, a **Streamlit app** was deployed for interactive store insights, allowing real-time monitoring and operational visualization in the field.

## Reporting
Reporting was enhanced using **R-based pipelines**, which generated automated reports directly from the database, reducing manual work and errors.

## Innovation
An **NLP-based workflow** was implemented to detect and correct SKU pricing and reporting errors, improving data accuracy. The project also explored modern analytics techniques to optimize operational monitoring.

## Impact
The project delivered an **automated analytics ecosystem** that reduced manual effort, improved data accuracy, and provided consistent, decision-ready insights across Pepsi’s operations.
