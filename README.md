# Pepsi Merchandising Analytics Automation

## Overview
Inspired by modern data pipelines, this project centralized operational and sales data into a single SQL database. The aim was to streamline data collection, reduce manual effort, and provide consistent, decision-ready insights to support merchandising and operational decisions.

## Data Pipeline
- Collected data from multiple operational sources using **Python scripts**.  
- Cleaned, validated, and processed the data before storing it in a **central SQL database**.  
- Automated queries and workflows ensured accurate and up-to-date data for reporting.

## Dashboard & Analytics
- Built a **Power BI dashboard** to visualize merchandising performance across stores and regions.  
- Enabled teams to track KPIs and gain actionable insights in near real-time.  

## Field Operations
- Developed a **Streamlit app** to provide interactive store-level insights for field teams.  
- Allowed managers and merchandisers to access operational data dynamically for better decision-making.

## Reporting
- Created **R-based pipelines** to generate automated reports directly from the SQL database.  
- Reduced manual report preparation and improved consistency across reporting outputs.

## Innovation
- Implemented a **YOLO-based computer vision model** to detect SKU availability in cooler images.  
- Enhanced monitoring and operational insight with automated detection of stock levels and merchandising compliance.

## Impact
- Delivered a fully **automated analytics workflow** that reduced manual work, improved data accuracy, and provided consistent, decision-ready insights across Pepsi operations.  
- The system improved efficiency in reporting, dashboards, and field monitoring, enabling faster strategic and operational decisions.
