# Pepsi-Merchandising-Operations-Automation

## Overview
This project focused on designing and implementing a **fully automated data pipeline** to centralize, clean, and analyze Pepsi's sales data. The goal was to reduce manual effort, improve data accuracy, and provide real-time insights to support decision-making across the organization.

## System Design
- Built a **Python-based ingestion pipeline** to automatically collect sales submissions from multiple sources.
- Implemented a **data cleaning workflow**, including:
  - Detection and correction of SKU pricing and reporting errors
  - Automated validation at the source to prevent manual mistakes
- Centralized all cleaned data into a **single SQL database** for streamlined access and querying.

## Analytics & Reporting
- Developed **Power BI dashboards** to visualize store-level to regional sales performance.
- Built **R-based reporting pipelines** to generate automated PowerPoint reports directly from the database.
- Consolidated multiple data sources to track key metrics in real-time, enabling faster and more informed decisions.

## Operational Tools
- Created a **Streamlit field application** to standardize and visualize store-level operations interactively.
- Supported internal teams with tools for data entry, monitoring, and reporting.

## Innovation
- Implemented a **YOLO-based computer vision model** to detect SKU availability from cooler images, improving inventory monitoring and operational insights.

## Impact
- Delivered a **fully automated analytics ecosystem** that reduced manual reporting, improved data accuracy, and provided consistent, decision-ready insights across Pepsi's operations.
- The system enabled real-time monitoring of sales promotions and operational KPIs, improving response times and strategic planning.
